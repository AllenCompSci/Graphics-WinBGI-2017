Inside this folder are two seperate folders. After Visual Studio's 2010 they updated conio.h so that no longer was kbhit() registerd as kbhit()
but now _kbhit(). Due to this and a few other changes, the winbgi.cpp and graphics.h files were updated and those updated versions are located
in the folder #C++11 - VS 2012-2015. The older versions are located in the VS2010 file.  A step by step guide is in the powerpoint where to 
copy these files to on your C Drive and how to access where your Visual Studio's file is placing those files.

If there are any questions. Feel free to email me, or ask about setup outside of class.


If for any reason at any time the graphics class doesn't work on the school's comptuer contact me immediately. You don't have access to modify
those files.
