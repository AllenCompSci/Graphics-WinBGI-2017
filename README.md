#Graphics Assignment

##Pick 2 of the 3 following assignments to complete. Use WinBGI to display the graphics.

1.	Create a program, that using a structure that defines, draws, and stores information 
about a line, create two lines at random. Check to see if the two lines intersect. Continue 
creating pairs of lines until one pair intersects.  At the PoI (Point of Intersection) draw 
a circle.  (Clear the device between draws)

2.	Create a program that generates a circle in the center of the screen. Draw a slightly 
larger black circle on top of it, and then change its center with some form of change in 
the x, and change in the y uniformly. Make sure that when it hits one of the edges of the 
screen. It stops, changes color, speed, and possibly size. Continue drawing in an infinite 
loop.

3.	Randomly create 3 Rectangles. Continue doing this and clearing the screen in between until 
you have 3 Rectangles who test each other for intersection and none of them do. 


##Remember all shapes/object displayed must be defined with a structure format, and have the 
##functions they use created defined inside them.
